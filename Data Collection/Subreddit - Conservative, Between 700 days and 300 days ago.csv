"Ruins the reputation of the president in Europe?  Lol.  They already hate Trump, and as America's president that is one of the reasons the American people support him.  Because he tells the globalists who are eating Europe alive to go shove it.

Plus, Sweden is continuing business as usual.  Are they dumb as fuck and making it spread faster?  Or is that actually the way that these pandemics have always gone?  Herd immunity is something that many (ignored) mainstream epidemiologists claim is the way that this will finally be over.  The vaccine is over a year away at best... at best.  Quarantine or not, the numbers will continue to grow until the vaccine is out.  Do we keep the country locked down for the next 18 months (all but ensuring socialism to take root) or do we go about our business and take responsibility for our own safety and continue to support ourselves?

If you are living a normal life, what would you do in this current situation if COVID didn't exist?  I think the vast majority of people would protest the current unprecedented government overreach.  

The discussions of digital IDs and vaccine certificates, the discussions of arm bands as a visible ""pass"" to conduct business, the arrest of people participating in outdoor activities, the mandated closure of gun stores, Chinese-made-and-donated drone observation by local police departments, government created ""snitch"" lines for reporting people not maintaining social distance, making small businessmen criminals by making business illegal, etc.

Really, we should all be protesting.

"I mean, he is most likely right. The most likely scenario is that eventually, we will have herd immunity, either through community-acquired infection or a vaccine, and the virus will go away. The author of this article seems to be completely missing that point. I really hate that journalists, who have no concept of virology or epidemiology post articles like this without having the first clue about how viruses with respiratory transmission work. I've seen a lot of liberals claiming that other countries have defeated the virus already, and the US is ignoring science, thus the virus is spreading more here. While it is true that the virus is spreading more here, we're also moving closer to that herd immunity threshold. The other countries will have to get there eventually as well. There does seem to be some ignorance of science here, and it ain't coming from people who understand that the only way we get out of this thing is via herd immunity (preferably achieved via a vaccine).

I mean, hell, it took one kid with measles to start an outbreak in California because we were under the herd immunity threshold there. Fortunately, most people receive their MMR vaccine, and we didn't have to have a worldwide pandemic of measles in order to contain it and get back to the herd immunity threshold. What do you think is going to happen with coronavirus in all of these places where so little of the population is immune? We're not even close to the proposed herd immunity threshold in the US. The rest of the world is certainly no closer. Do people really think that everyone else in the world is done with this thing? If so, I have some oceanfront property in Arizona to sell you.

I mean, just look at the opening paragraph:

&gt;Donald Trump continues to insist the coronavirus will ""disappear"", despite the recent surge in cases in several states like California, Texas, Arizona and Florida, and in contradiction of advice by public health experts that predict a long battle with the virus.

The last part disproves his contention that it's at all a contradiction. In fact, the only contradiction is the author's contention that the virus will not go away despite Trump's comments. Public health experts predict a long battle with the virus. They do not predict an *indefinite* battle with the virus. That means that eventually, whether that's months or years from now, public health experts agree with Trump that eventually the virus will go away. It amazes me that someone could publish something so stupid in the very first few sentences.

I also love how the implication from the author that 140,000 Americans having died from COVID-19 is somehow Trump's fault. The reality is that people are going to die from this no matter what we do; it's something we're going to have to accept. There is no Santa Claus; there is no Easter Bunny; the Tooth Fairy isn't real. The only difference is *when* people get it and *when* they will die, not *if* they will get it and *if* they will die. What is real is that in the absence of an effective treatment or a vaccine, so long as we don't overwhelm the healthcare system (which currently we are not), then the same number of people will die from coronavirus no matter how much we flatten the curve; the areas under both the tall and flat curve is the same (meaning same total number of infections and death for those that can't do simple calculus).

&gt;What the US has not seen in recent weeks or months, despite Mr Trump's claims, was any sign the coronavirus was disappearing.

Right, because it's not disappearing yet. Right now, it is growing in numbers. Well, yeah. When we loosen lockdown measures, in addition to gathering in large groups (i.e. protests), the number of cases will increase; that does not mean that those cases would have never happened at all but rather that they happened sooner. It's pretty frustrating that people don't seem to understand this concept. Also, does this loon really not understand the meaning of the word *eventually*? It's right in the freaking title of the article he posted: ""I'll be right **eventually**."" It's almost like Trump didn't say that it's going to disappear tomorrow or even next week. *Eventually* could be a few months from now; it could be year or two from now. *Eventually*, it will go away. How is that so hard to understand?

This author clearly doesn't understand how any of the science works, and he might want to revisit his pompous and combative tone when we can do a retrospective analysis of the data when we are actually done with SARS-CoV-2.",1.0,Conservative,2020-07-19 18:09:44
"OK ok, let's play pretend a little bit.

So you are play-pretending an emphatic person who cares about TB, a problem with around 3000 deaths in the US, HIV-positive individuals being at greatest risk. So what you are suggesting, as an emphatic and not at all crazy and blinded by hate person then, is for US, with all its resources, to say divert 10 billion of US defense budget to combat TB in areas affected and develop medical infrastructure in poor countries. Yes?

Oh, no... you just gobbled up conspiracy theories about covid-19 which was used by conservative agenda to rile you up and you palpate in the dark of ignorance for any arguments to justify your feelings that were implanted in your brain by people who do indeed have shady interests in keeping you in this state. Someone probably tried the ""it's just the flu"" maneuver, but it wasn't effective so they went with something harder to understand like TB and it stuck.

And you know why covid is even an issue? Because some absolute nutjobs ignored it and democrats had reacted to those nutjobs. And since democrats appear to care about it... then republicans have to be against it. That's  it. Tribalism at its finest.

And who benefits with their shady dealings from this chaos? Republicans, because that's the only way they could hold power which they in turn need to make their shady deals and... China, Russia, enemies of the US. Just imagine that - China is viewed as having been extremely effective in dealing with covid while the world looks at the US like a fucking mental asylum where people can't even stop themselves from spreading the virus intentionally.

edit;
Oh wait I didn't even read your last sentence before... Yeah because fucking immigrants will infect Americans with TB and it's not like they'll get the vaccine immediately if they didn't have one before, and death rates in US from TB aren't low because of the medical infrastructure...

And you call yourself an ""emphatic"" human being. You are both stupid and evil, filled with and blinded by hate spoon fed to you by propaganda. It's disgusting.

"I can't speak for everyone on here, but I dont really see people bragging about not wearing a mask. Granted maybe I dont notice because I'm not looking for it.

Personally I dont like wearing a mask and I dont particularly see them as being very helpful/necessary. I've read A LOT of the studies published and they are usually extremely reliant on pretty big assumptions. Id rather not go down that convo road tho. Now I am all for social distancing, good hygiene (hand washing, avoiding touching public surfaces, etc.), and avoiding large gatherings. I think these are  MUCH more effective in preventing the spread. Now if I lived with a vulnerable person or regularly came into contact with one, I would be more careful and willing to wear a mask. Now this isnt to say I don't wear one. My state has wearing one as a rule so I follow it. I do think it should be a business/company decision over the state but I won't fight it. I live in Florida and they have been very reasonable with their lockdowns and rules so I won't complain too much 😉 

And yes, there really weren't tests when places like NYC got hit so it is hard to really give it a fair analysis but we do know they had an absurd amount of death regardless. So yes the death rates were prob lower than we think/thought but they are still way above normal.

I hate that this has been hijacked politically. Its the worst thing that could have happened. Hopefully a vaccine gets made but like you said, there are meds that have shown a lot of promise in slowing it down and keeping it under control.

The herd immunity percentage keeps changing lol I think it was like 40% but I've heard up to like 65%. People need to make up their minds lol

Anyways, I hope both you and your spouse stay safe!

"&gt;This is literally all the MSM's fault for absolutely dumbing our country down every single day. 

I agree.

&gt;Biden/Harris are the ones to be truly worried about if they steal the election somehow with how dangerous Harris would be as President.

I don't know that she'd be dangerous to left-leaning folks who want what she's selling, but I'm certain she is a disaster for the 2nd Amendment and I'd expect her to be happy to spend taxpayers money on God knows what crazy projects. I think she is mentally stable and sane though, I just disagree with her politics and her ethics. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; What is there truly to fear about Trump? 

I think what they fear is that he'll push more policies they don't like. They are worried about abortion rights and race relations and gay marriage to name a few. Personally I don't think Trump is going to do anything radical in any of those areas. 

The other things they are afraid of though, I am afraid of too. Mainly the fact that he seems to be a pathological liar, incredibly egotistical and arrogant and not especially smart. I think he's erratic and unpredictable and that's a problem. That said, I do not hate Trump the way they do and there is NO way I will vote for Biden either.  I'm stuck voting for the libertarian candidate again because it's the only choice I can stomach in this race. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;He's done good for our country financially through his policies, tax breaks, raising our GDP, bringing jobs back.

The economy was doing well under Trump prior to COVID, I agree. I also think it's bullshit how people blame him for COVID and the economic impact it's had. That would have happened no matter who was president. COVID is not his fault. He could have managed it better yes, but he did a lot of things right too. Like shutting down travel from China and other countries early on and pushing companies to make masks and respirators and firing up the vaccine initiative, pushing for medications to be approved and released. 

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;undoing damage from the last five administrations, winning peace prizes etc.

Yeah, I'm not one of those people who thinks Obama was the antichrist and ruined the country and Trump ""fixed"" it. Sorry. Obama did plenty of things I didn't like, but he was a capable president and definitely far more sensible and level-headed than Trump.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Kamala is the one to truly be worried about. She is a miserable, shitty canidate with a awful track record and Nancy Pelosi needs to fully be removed from her position as well.

Yeah, I can't stand Kamala either. She seems like a nightmare candidate to me. Basically on the opposite side or extreme of almost every issue from me. I hate her nasally voice and condescending attitude too. Can't imaging having to listen to her give speeches and talk on TV for 4 years. Fuck that, she will be on mute.

"It’s not that conservatives think nothing is going on - it’s that the solution being pushed is completely unrealistic and countless countries continue to prove it is pointless. There are no solutions to problems - only trade offs. The trade off for delaying Covid deaths is destroying people’s livelihoods, reducing the likelihood that low income kids will finish high school with virtual learning, and putting our kids on the hook for 3T+ in additional tax debt for a virus that is not going away.

Sweden did not lock down, didnt wear masks, did not shut down schools for under 15, and has had less than 10 deaths a day for months now. This is a highly contagious virus, and lockdowns have never stopped a virus before. The plan should be to let the young and healthy live their lives and protect the vulnerable so this can be over with as soon as possible. Dragging this thing out for 7+ months just means you can’t keep the vulnerable protected and they end up getting it anyway. Look at CA - heavy mask usage for months, never had indoor dining, arrested people walking alone on trails and paddle boarding - still had a CFR comparable to TX and FL with minimal restrictions (and higher obesity).

Lockdowns do not do anything other than delay deaths (which is also good but should be balanced). Argentina is a good example of how lockdowns do not work. The USA has several examples as well.

https://www.rt.com/news/502652-argentina-coronavirus-test-positive-rate/

 We are a wealthy, highly populated, and free country. The methods applied in other countries with reduced rates would not work here. NZ is an island. South Korea is effectively an island. Taiwan has an extremely obedient population. Vietnam is poor and has no where near the travel seen in the states. The media pushes this narrative that anti-maskers/anti-science conservatives are the reason we can’t get the cases to zero, and it’s just to point the blame at someone they want you to hate. USA wears masks just as frequently or more than other countries, USA google mobility data was basically identical to other countries that “crushed the curve”(initially but later had a second wave). The USA is on par with most other similar countries with our travel/density/wealth, but is actually doing good if you look at our obesity compared to other countries. 

The only way this stops is if a vaccine comes out asap, and it’s mandated for everyone. Since that is not happening (polls show 25-35% of people would actually get it), just let people live their lives.

Look past the emotion driven news stories. These lockdowns will be looked back on as a colossal failure. WHO is already saying they are a bad idea. This is a dangerous response for a disease that has not shown to be much worse that numerous other viruses in the past 30 years.

The USS Harry Truman (which i have several friends on) has been deployed much more in the last 4 years, for example. He just SAYS he has, that’s what he does. He SAYS “I said I’d do it, and I did it.” 

2.) the wall was a major rally cry and he failed to do ALL KINDS of things around it “who’s gonna pay for it?!!” *points mic at audience* “that’s right, Mexico will pay for it”. He had to find a way to get immigration down by another way because his words and plans failed.

3.) he said he was making “major moves, were doing all we can, we’re controlling it better than anybody” when asked about gun control plans on live tv. Literally every day the man said something that contradicted something else he said for 4 years- of course he “did what he said”..... he said it all! That’s how he covered his ass, hes the most inconsistent man that ever even got in office, let alone the presidency.

4.) the jobs were already going up when he got in office- he’d have to have major fuckups to slow it down. And this past month? When basically everyone around the world is still improving their job increase rate from lockdown, us jobs are going up at a decreasing rate. We’re plateauing and leveling out. Serious fuck up to do that. He just SAYS they are. Boeing is laying off 30,000. “So many car plants” in MI that simply don’t exist. He just stands in front of the UN and SAYS they exist.

"I don't like commenting on political things, but I have a lot of friends in the asian american community here in the United States.  These friends range from immigrants, to 4th generation citizens, and come from places like Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, and (of course) China.  Some of them fled the revolution to seek a better life here.  There has been a [rise](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7364747/) in hate crimes against asian minorities in this country, and a lot of that has to do with Trump's rhetoric regarding the virus.  My Vietnamese American friends are worried about getting harassed on the street by random people who are listening to that rhetoric and blaming the virus on asians in general.

The initial spread of the Coronavirus is absolutely the fault of the Chinese Communist Party, for failing to contain it and failing to properly regulate the wet markets where it originated.  Trump was right to block travel from China (though covid still made it to the US through Europe, with those sources causing the initial NYC outbreak). I'd even go so far as to say that the Trump admin has done a decent job working with private industry to get vaccine development done fast.  But I'm here, telling you from personal interactions, that my (American citizen) friends have been made to feel unsafe in this country because of Trump's rhetoric.  Average joe schmo cannot differentiate someone from China from an someone of Asian descent who lives in their community and has never been to China.  That's why people are calling out Trump's rhetoric as racist and dangerous.  He's stoking literal violence against Americans.  As much as people hate to admit it, Trump has a lot of influence in this country right now, and a lot of passionate people who care a lot about ""America"" hang on his every word.  When Trump calls it the ""China Virus"" long after it has become an American problem, he could have easily said something else.  Deflecting blame for the impact of the virus on our communities onto China has real consequences for people who live and work here.

Please don't dismiss these concerns as some scheme for Pelosi or Schumer to win political battles.  I get that democrats like using racial rhetoric to gain votes, but here, in this case, my friends are being made to feel unsafe in their homeland.

"But if everyone caught coronavirus there would be roughly 5 mil deaths in America (assuming the same death rate) and if they all caught it within a short amount of time the hospitals would be overrun and that creates additional deaths due to cases like heart attacks/car accidents/stroke/any other emergency etc. I don’t think 200k deaths have been over reported.. if anything it’s been under reported. I can’t think of any national crisis that killed so many people being such a partisan issue. 

Also the evidence shows that lockdowns and masks work. There have been numerous countries that have eliminated or contained COVID with these measures... I hate anything that infringes on personal liberties but I think with a health issue like this you’ve got to bite the bullet and do what’s best for the greater good. 

The big benefit that a vaccine has against the virus is that the vaccine won’t kill anyone. If you try and get herd immunity by infecting everyone you are going to have a huge amount of deaths. Also this virus will change (similar to the flu every year) the vaccine will need to be continually updated. If we don’t have an effective vaccine to begin with we will not be able to prepare for mutations in the virus meaning that next year we will need to get herd immunity all over again.",1.0,Conservative,2020-11-27 20:31:57
"&gt;It seems like American conservatives don't understand growth economics at all. That's especially true in the Trump era, with the renewed focus on legacy resource extraction and manufacturing at the expense of high tech and intellectual property industries, which are more valuable and provide better opportunities for long term sustainable growth.

So I didn't vote for Trump. There are Democratic tickets I could have brought myself to cast a vote for but any with Kamala Harris was not one of them.

Only vote for President I have cast for a major party candidate was Mitt Romney in 2012

But in this I believe you are flouting your own advice a bit in ignoring market externalities--the loss of a manufacturing center **is** a negative market externality with often negative results on social safety nets and a country's budget.

&gt;I see them demonizing our imperfect, but critical education system from top to bottom.

Pointing out flaws is not demonizing--I can't think of any Republican who supports eliminating public education:

In fact even under Trump as much as I hate him education spending per pupil continues to increase:

https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/school-system-finances.html

The US even spends more on education than any other country:

https://www.insider.com/how-much-countries-around-the-world-spend-on-education-2019-8

The conservative answer to that is to step back and think ""maybe the issue isn't just funding and the solution isn't throw more money and more government at it until it fixes itself""

It would be to look at the administrative and bureaucratic flaws for why the system is failing even with funding and why teacher salaries are stagnating even as those in administrative positions continue to see their salaries rise

Note: this does not mean destroying the system--it means certain reforms to fix its failings

It's why even though I definitely don't support privatizing education I think certain targeted school choice and voucher programs and charter school expansions are a big part of fixing education--not on a huge scale and with proper oversight to prevent abuse--but the ideas themselves seem to be something conservative that even communities that are overwhelmingly Democratic agree with me on:

https://www.mackinac.org/democratic-minority-voters-overwhelmingly-favor-school-choice

As for research again as awful as Trump is and as bad as the response to Covid has been--from feuds with Fauci, to playing red vs blue states to making masks a culture war issue and holding mask and distancing free rallies--one thing I believe he did better than a Democratic administration would have is the vaccine development--something even Fauci called the one good part of the virus response.

It was done via a public-private partnership--the kind a Dem administration would have resented--instead boxing out the resources of the private sector and only allowing government to work on a vaccine

Same thing goes for something like space travel--it's not ""anti science"" (the current GOP does have some positions that are anti science on the environment--I acknowledge that and hope it changes--but I digress) to think government shouldn't be the sole force of scientific development and take a supplementary role with the more efficient private sector

As for healthcare it is really something I am conflicted about--as a medical resident the thought of having worked all those years in high school stressing over the thought of an A-, making sure to get a 1550+ SAT and fill my resume with ECs to get to a top college, slaving away in the pre med classes there and in MCAT Prep to get to med school and the hell that awaited there--plus residency and hopefully specialization--**just to be a government employee as a part of a bureaucratic mess of a system that would amount to a healthcare version of the DMV** is a depressing one

But I get that the ACA--as much as I think it's bad policy--isn't just something that can be repealed without a replacement (and know the GOP doesn't have one)

As of now I guess I hope for the status quo but I believe we are heading to socialized medicine--as awful as it sounds to me and feels like I wasted my efforts",1.0,Conservative,2020-12-02 04:20:26
"https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/operation-warp-speed-trump-pfizer-moderna-vaccine-1.5806820

Let's talk Moderna:

&gt; ""No doubt, Operation Warp Speed is a huge success,"" said Tinglong Dai, associate professor of Operations Management and Business Analytics at Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School in Baltimore.

&gt; ""You can like or hate the Trump administration, but no doubt, it's a huge success — unprecedented success.""

&gt; Jesse Goodman, the former chief scientist of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, agreed that the U.S. government deserves credit for the high priority placed on Operation Warp Speed.

&gt; ""This is a bright spot in the pandemic response. I mean, the rest of it has been dismal,"" said Goodman, who is also director of Georgetown University's Center on Medical Product Access, Safety and Stewardship.

&gt; Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also lauded Operation Warp Speed for being a ""success — certainly in the arena of vaccines, it's been a success"" in his remarks at a recent virtual summit organized by the medical news site Stat.

&gt; Launched in May, Operation Warp Speed (OWS) is a government initiated private/public $10 billion US program to help provide support to companies in the development, manufacturing and distribution of 300 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine, with the aim of having initial doses ready by January 2021

&gt; The experts agree that Operation Warp Speed played a significant role in Moderna's development of a potential vaccine. 

&gt; ""Without OWS, there would be no Moderna vaccine. Period,"" Dai said.

&gt; Allison Winnike, president of the Texas-based Immunization Partnership, an organization providing advocacy and information about immunization initiatives, said that Moderna benefited tremendously from Operation Warp Speed, in part, by receiving close to $1 billion to support its vaccine development and clinical trials.

Now, let's talk Pfizer:

&gt; ""Pfizer is a very large company with substantial cash reserves,"" Goodman said. ""I'm sure that [OWS] was helpful. I'm not sure about [whether] it wouldn't have happened without it.""

&gt; Walter Orenstein, a former director of the U.S. Immunization Program and former deputy director for immunization programs at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, said Operation Warp Speed has played a major role by guaranteeing a market to Pfizer so it can begin developing its procedures for distribution.

&gt; He agreed that the policy initiative is an exception to how the Trump administration has handled the pandemic and that his ""personal opinion is [OWS] has helped substantially.""

&gt; ""I can't see this large an effort by this many companies going forward in this fashion without substantial support that has come [through] Operation Warp Speed.""

Of course OWS and Pfizer don't have a perfect relationship, but please stop saying they have no involvement or didn't help. *You* might say they didn't help based on your personal perception of what is truly ""helpful,"" but if the experts are saying it helped, then obviously I'm going to take their word over your opinion.",1.0,Conservative,2020-12-12 06:45:08

2- I think the way that trump was suggesting we get there was the issue. The way I was made to believe is that he wanted everyone to get exposed and a level of Covid so we can reach hers immunity.

3- I think the change now is that we immunize people to help speed up the process in a safer manner.

I give trump all the credit in the world on being right on vaccine time line and hope the history remembers it that way. However if he was so certain it was going to be quickly developed that he could have done something to mitigate exposure and help people be safe?

Of course not.  Brigading liberals hate to discuss all of the facts.  It's typically preferable to stick to the convenient ones.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I understand why you deflect though. Cruz is at the very bottom of the barrel of leadership. He supports seditionists and domestic terrorists out of political expediency. He let Trump call his wife ugly because god forbid he upset the knuckle-dragging mob. 

There was no deflection.  It was a direct refutation of the point you attempted to make.  

""Seditionists and domestic terrorists"" wow really uniting the country there, huh?  Since you're deflecting, let's discuss how the left has been undermining the country for decades.  Like when the President calls concentration camps ""cultural differences"" to appease the nation he sold us out to.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; And in this case, Cruz flys to Cancun when Texans need his immediate help. This guy clearly doesn’t give two shits about anyone but himself. 

Sorry kids, we can't go on vacation like I promised.  I have to stay home and virtue signal to appease the woke mob.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; At least 24 people are dead because Cruz, Abbott and other GOP leaders willfully and proudly abdicate the most rudimentary aspects of governance. 

Abbot is potentially fair game.  But I was unaware Cruz sat on a committee having oversight of the Texas electrical grid.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It echoes Trump’s lack of preparedness and MIA response to pandemics. The GOP is presently defined by 2 things: systemic corruption and an absence of leadership. 

For someone who complained about deflecting you do an awful lot of it. But I do like the topic, so let's talk about both of these blatantly false narratives.  

Trump was the first public official to act on COVID.  It's the very definition of leadership.  He correctly identified the source and had the stones to call it out against all of the prevailing narratives and attacks for ""xenophobia"".  He also called for the country to re-open when numbers receded which was the correct call because as we can see now Democrats seem determined to never allow us to return to normal.  

The Biden administration is now anonymously leaking that there was ""Literally no plan"" for vaccination.  Of course this is laughable since Trump spearheaded the development of a vaccine faster than the liberal haters said was possible.  And it contradicts what even Anthony Fauci himself has said repeatedly and consistently to this day.  It also fails to explain how so many people have already been vaccinated.

Ands let's PLEASE talk about corruption.  Because we just found out the FBI essentially allowed itself to work on behalf of the Clinton campaign for 4 years.  If you cared to read real news you would know that Jim Comey admitted he illegally leaked these fake stories to the press to affect public perception and also knew the Steel Dossier was fake the whole time.  He knew it was fake when he certified a FISA application using the Steel Dossier as the central piece of evidence.

We also know that the FBI was aware in 2016 that the entire Russia narrative originated inside the Clinton campaign.  This wasn't even ""oppo research"".  This was literally the campaign ""conjuring up"" the story.  I put that term in quotes because that's how John Brennan characterized it in his notes that he used to brief Obama and Comey.

Let's talk about how Joe Biden takes a cut of his son Hunter's paychecks.  Let's talk about how strange that is.  I mean it would less strange if Joe got his crackhead son a position on the board of a billion dollar foreign energy company he had absolutely no experience in and then wanted a kickback for getting him that job.  All that and Joe fired the prosecutor that Burisma needed fired.  I guess that's all a coincidence to you?

"I see that you conveniently left out Moderna, that was developed directly under operation warp speed.  Additionally Pfizer did take money, although it was later on for distribution.  The government was also fully directed to get the vaccines out, and that means that the barriers for approval (done by the federal government) would work more quickly on them.  So any sentiment that Trump's administrations efforts did not create the Moderna vaccine and expedite all the vaccines being ready and produced with alacrity are just false.  Just because Trump isn't responsible for every step in the process having been done doesn't mean he gets no credit, which I always see people work exceptionally hard to deprive him of regardless of how valid the arguments are.

Considering that every single country got blindsided by covid I think that this notion that Trump had more insight than all of them is not a fair claim as well.  I mean if it was so obvious, how did it take everyone by surprise at how bad it was?  Is your argument that Trump was smarter than all of them and still chose not to act?

You don't know what the word fascism means and it's painfully clear. I don't expect retards to know much but you should at least look up the word. The closest thing to fascism in this country is the democratic party and that's solely due to their authoritarian edicts and policies.

"I think that what it comes down to is people just hate Anti-vaxxers and associate all the people who don't want the covid 19 vaccine as the same who don't vaccinate their children for measles.

I personally don't care either way for a vaccination passport because if people would actually just wear their masks and distance responsibly like they were supposed to we wouldn't be in this situation we are currently in. The people refusing to vaccinate are unfortunately in the same group of covid deniers who think that wearing a mask is ""tyranny"" and don't want to do it even in private businesses. 

I think an even better solution would be to pass a law that anyone who doesn't take the pandemic seriously and is acting irresponsibly should be punished in the conservative way...by letting your private health insurance companies refuse to pay for your treatment or drop you entirely. It's your right and freedom to choose not to wear a mask or work toward ending the pandemic...but why should your insurance company pay hundreds of thousands for you if you end up in the hospital?

"&gt;Trump sent federal troops in when rioters were threatening federal employees and property, this occured most notably at that courthouse BLM/Antifa rioters were trying to break into/burn down. 

Yep! There were solid reasons, just like there are solid reasons for the NG being deployed in DC. Perhaps you forgot, but there was a pretty significant riot on the 6th of January. Again, not saying I agree with the logic, but there are clear parallels for both sides. ((Because both sides are 95% the same, they want to get rich and help out their rich friends that fund their campaigns. They don't give a fuck about you or me.))

&gt;to be able to freely move through your own country, while your ability to move freely is being questioned constantly 

Where is this happening in the US? I'm genuinely asking, what states or federal agencies have said that **travel** will be restricted if you don't have a vaccine passport? (If this is being proposed by the government I'm going to do a 180 real fast because I hate the idea of checkpoints inside our borders for any reason.)

I know plenty of businesses have talked about having these as a requirement. I hate that idea, but it is their right. I am a huge supporter of private property rights. That is literally the strongest association I have with conservative politics, so I am 100% in support of allowing businesses to decide their own policies as long as they follow the law. I'm not getting any COVID vaccines until they're fully approved by the FDA so I'd be banned from businesses that require proof of vaccination, but that's their loss not mine.

I genuinely apologize if I insulted you by asking about your service. You're right that you don't need to have served to care about it, but it seems like one of those things that only civilians would really raise as an issue because anyone who has been in knows this is par for the course.

"Well, you were pretty vague about ""dems pushing unpopular policies,"" and those are the two biggest things they've done in the last few months, so it's not cherry picking.
Vaccine passports haven't been a Democrat only policy proposal. Seems everyone from airlines to cruise lines to countries with borders (ie, all of them) are discussing the idea. Should you, and how would you, place restrictions on travel based on vaccination. It's a valid question, especially in a ****ing pandemic. 
Eh, prove it. More notable is how people hate Obamacare, but love the affordable care act, as if they're different.

[Fauci lied about masks](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/dr-fauci-made-the-coronavirus-pandemic-worse-by-lying-about-masks/ar-BB15zyW3)

Excerpt:
    
    Fauci... hinted that he knew masks worked, he just wanted any
    available masks to be saved for health care workers.
    “Well, the reason for that is that we were concerned the public health
    community, and many people were saying this, were concerned that it
    was at a time when personal protective equipment, including the N-95
    masks and the surgical masks, were in very short supply,” Fauci said. 
    “And we wanted to make sure that the people, namely the health care
    workers, who were brave enough to put themselves in a harm way, to
    take care of people who you know were infected with the coronavirus
    and the danger of them getting infected.”
    Fauci didn’t just fail to promote masks early on, he actively discouraged
    the use of masks, saying they didn’t work. Americans are now paying the
    price because too many people think masks are useless to combat the
    coronavirus. In reality, masks have been shown to help prevent the spread
    of covid-19, as the CDC now admits.


# Why do you want to trust a known liar, who not only advised the president, and by all accounts from the administration, lied?

The simple truth is that Faucci doesn't communicate what the truth is, only what he wants to manipulate Americans into doing. Faucci has blood on his hands. He knew early about the masks, and how they would help save lives during the initial spike, but he withheld the information. Probably getting hundreds of thousands killed or infected in the process.

Now he says to keep wearing them. In fact, wear two masks. What is he lying to us about now? 

[https://principia-scientific.com/covid-19-masks-causing-rise-in-bacterial-pneumonia/](https://principia-scientific.com/covid-19-masks-causing-rise-in-bacterial-pneumonia/) Principia Scientifica says that they cause Pneumonia when worn too long.

[NIH.gov says they were the cause of the greatest loss of life during the 1918 pandemic](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/bacterial-pneumonia-caused-most-deaths-1918-influenza-pandemic)

Not only that, we have some anecdotal evidence. Cases are dropping in Texas, Florida, and every place they take the masks off and put their ""foot on the gas"". 


Finally, the number one reason, I know Dr. Faucci is full of shit and a liar? [He wrote about the effects of masks during a pandemic, staph and strep turn into bacterial pneumonia when you wear masks too long. NIH.gov ](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/bacterial-pneumonia-caused-most-deaths-1918-influenza-pandemic)
